# PicoController_GUI
 A Python controller for Newport Picomotor and its controller

The program is based on Python3 on Windows. You need to install inputs, PyUSB, and PYQT5 (for the GUI version) before using.\
Usually you may want you the GUI version; there is also a terminal version for debugging.\
Thanks to Ben Hammel for his Python driver.
